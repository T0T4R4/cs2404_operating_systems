# Running the C File on Linux, macOS, and Windows

This repository contains a simple C code file named `file_io.c` that demonstrates file input/output operations. This README provides instructions on how to compile and run the C code on different platforms: Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Prerequisites

Before running the C code, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Linux**: A C compiler like GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) should be pre-installed on most Linux distributions. If not, install it using the package manager specific to your distribution.

- **macOS**: macOS comes with the LLVM-based Clang C compiler pre-installed. If you prefer GCC, you can install it using Homebrew or MacPorts.

- **Windows**: For compiling C code on Windows, you have multiple options:

  - **Visual Studio**: Install Visual Studio with C++ workload, which includes the MSVC (Microsoft Visual C++) compiler.

  - **MinGW**: Install MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows), which provides a Windows port of GCC.

  - **On Linux under WSL**: Refer to Linux above

## Compiling and Running on Linux or MacOS

1. Open a terminal.

2. Navigate to the directory containing `file_io.c`.

3. Compile the C code using GCC:

`gcc -c file_io.c -o file_io.o`

The -c flag tells the compiler to generate the object code (.o file), and the -o flag specifies the output file name.

4. Link the object code

`gcc file_io.o -o file_io`

The `file_io.o` file is the object code generated by the compiler, and the `-o file_io` flag specifies the output file name for the final executable.

4. Run the compiled program:

`./file_io`

## Compiling and Running on Windows (Visual Studio)

1. Open the Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio or ensure that the following directory is added to the PATH global environment variable (ex. for VS 2019):
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.29.30037\bin\Hostx64\x64\`

2. Navigate to the directory containing `file_io.c`.

3. Compile the C code using the MSVC compiler (cl.exe):

Open the Visual Studio console, 
(or the equivalent on your machine)

Then run `cl /c file_io.c`

The `/c` flag tells the compiler to generate the object code (`.obj` file).

4. Linking

`link file_io.obj`

By default, `link` will produce an output file with the same name as the first input file (in this case, `file_io.obj`), so the output file will be `file_io.exe`.

4. Run the compiled program:
`file_io.exe`

## Summary

By following the instructions above, you can compile and run the `file_io.c` C code on Linux, macOS, and Windows using different C compilers. The program will create a file named `example.txt` and write the message "Hello, this is a test." to it. If successful, you should see no errors, and the file should be created in the same directory as the executable.

Note: This example focuses on simplicity and does not include comprehensive error handling.
